# SAP-Online-Track-2020
Code for SAP Online Track May 2020

Thus far I have just written a really basic program where you improt a speadsheet of which speakers have chosen which three slots as their first second and third choices, and it uses assorted strategies to try and find the optimal agenda, and shows the result proposals from best to worst.

The import file shoudl be an XLSX spreadsheet and the format like this - speaker name followed by slot choices.
ANT     	  2	  3	  5
ANTEATER	  16	17	18
BADGER	    5	  6	  7
BEAR	      16	17	18
COCKROACH	  18	19	20
COW	        6	  7	  8
DONKEY    	1	  2	  3
DUCK	      22	23	24

Where 1 = 12- 13 hours on Saturday 30th May, and 24 = 11-12 hours on Sunday 31st May, GMT (UST)
